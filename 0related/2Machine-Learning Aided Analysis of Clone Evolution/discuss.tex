Our method depends on NiCad and clone mapping algorithm to build clone genealogy. We use NiCad to detect clones, the results of which are then used for mapping the clones so as to build clone genealogy. A more refined clone detection tool and a more accurate clone mapping algorithm may possibly improve the quality of the subsequent phases. Note that our approach strongly depends on the availability of clone metrics. We use a set of metrics to represent clone fragment, clone group, clone genealogy. While these metrics have served us well, we would like to expand the collection of metrics in the future, as new interesting metrics can hint on possibly new relationship between clones and their evolution. 

In the future, we can also conduct more experiments on different softwares with more clone metrics. We believe that we have presented some more meaningful conclusions to help clone analysis and clone maintenance. We can also do some further work on clone characteristics. We believe that clone characteristics should be used in clone analysis during system maintenance. For instance, we can identify some special clone from softwares, and we intend to link this to clone harmfulness.
